# first_yr_dbms_proj
This is our DBMS primitive project that we have successfully completed.

Brief Description:
This is a primitive railway reservation and management system which comprises the principles of dbms and is integrated with technologies such as HTML,CSS,PHP(server scripting lang) and JS. We have also used bootstrap for easier styling and some reference in CSS.

This project is locally hosted by XAMPP local host service and the DBMS used is PHPMYADMIN so you may have to make the tables locally and setup the environment locally to have this work.
